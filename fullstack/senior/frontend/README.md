To launch project, please go to "fullstack/senior/frontend", and type:
```bash
yarn
yarn start
#This will open your browser to http://localhost:3000
```

You should see something like this:

![React App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kekelol/tech-challenges/master/fullstack/senior/frontend/App%20Front.png)

The app is made fully with ReactJS and interacts with a PHP endpoint at "http://localhost:8080/XX2".

I recommand the usage of Google Chrome since the I've been using the "fetch" API for AJAX requests.
